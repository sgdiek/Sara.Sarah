# Mini Group Assignment

# Project Title and Link to Proposal
San Francisco: Crime and Green Space
[Proposal](https://github.com/sgdiek/Sara.Sarah/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/Project%20Proposal%20Markdown.md) 

# Roles
We plan to work through the majority of the midterm together. We think it is important for each of us to contribute to both the maps and charts.
Sara T. will do the data exploration for crime. Sarah D. will do the data exploration for green space. We are unsure exactly how we will split up the maps. For example, one of us will make a map for petty crimes while the other makes a map for felonies. Or, we will take a look at the top 2 most common crimes in SF and split those up between us to create maps of each. 

# Status Update
Morale is high. We work really well together. We have had an easy time scheduling meeting times each week. We have been splitting the work evenly and helping each other troubleshoot when stuck. We communicate well with each of us being very responsive.
