# Research Question 
What is the relationship between parks and crime in San Francisco? How does the number of incidents reported relate to the number of parks in a neighborhood? What are the most frequent types of incidents reported in neighborhoods with the lowest amount of parks? Does seasonality and proximity to parks influence the number of incidents reported?

# Why Parks and Crime?
Parks have been lauded as spaces for community interaction and viewed as spaces where communities come together. At the same time, more contemporary discourse on parks and green spaces has revolved around the privatization of such spaces and how that impacts certain aspects of commuity dynamics, like policing and safety. Our goal is to understand how parks impact community safety, and to see if our findings point in the direction of parks existing as an alternative to policing and/or as a method of promoting community safety.

# Spatial Scope
Our research will stay within the boundaries of the City of San Francisco. Space is key to our research with the Police Department data providing the locations of reported incidents and Parks and Recreation data from data.sfgov.org providing geospatial data on parks in San Francisco. We will look at the neighborhood where incidents are reported along with the amount and size of parks in these neighborhoods. Looking at this data will allow us to understand whether there is correlation between parks and incident reports. We will also use time to examine if there is a significant variation in crime and park correlation across seasons. Our data will cover the year 2019 specifically.

# Description of Data Sources
## [*SF Police Department Incident Reports*](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783)
This dataset provides San Francisco Police Department incident reports that have been filed as of January 1, 2018. Included is the date and time the incident occurred as well as incident category, neighborhood where incident occurred, and the closest street intersection to where the incident occurred. There are three types of reports that make up this dataset:

* Initial Reports: the first report filed by officers for an incident
* Coplogic Reports: incident reports filed by members of the public using SFPDâ€™s online reporting system
* Vehicle Reports: any incident reports related to stolen and/or recovered vehicles

## [*SF Parks and Recreation*](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Recreation-and-Parks-Properties/gtr9-ntp6)
This dataset provides geospatial data on various kinds of parks and recreational spaces in San Francisco. The PropertyType column provides the designation of the particular space. For our research, we will be looking at Neighborhood Parks or Playgrounds, Mini Parks, and Regional Parks. The dataset also includes the neighborhood the park is located in, the size of each park, and coordinates for the parks. 

# Scope of Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations
The data derived from the datasets above will be used to analyze the relationship between parks and incident reports. The end goal is to create a cartographic visualization that highlights the number and type of incident reports by neighborhood and map that against parks across the city and investigate any potential overlap. Additionally, we are interested in exploring the seasonal relationship between incident reports and parks. Since park usage varies seasonally, with warmer months experiencing more park usage, we want to see if this influences the number of incident reports across San Francisco. We are also interested in exploring the potential of bringing in proximity as a variable of interest, however, we have yet to explore this in our data. 

# Conclusion
Our research will provide insight into whether the presence of parks in San Francisco neighborhoods increases or reduces reported crime. By analyzing this relationship by neighborhood, we can determine how different types and the amount of parks influence potential offenders and victims. We can then better understand the spatial distribution of crime and parks in order to recommend crime prevention measures.
