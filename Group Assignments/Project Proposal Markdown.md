# Introduction to Research Question
We are hoping to examine the relationship between crime and green space in the City of San Francisco. Studies have shown that well-maintained green space has the potential to reduce violent crime. Alternatively, not well-maintained green space may encourage crime in the area. We will take a spatial look at where crime incidents and green space correlate and where they do not. Our research question is: What is the relationship between crime and open green space in San Francisco?

# Why Green Space and Crime?
Open green areas have been lauded as spaces for community interaction and viewed as spaces where communities come together. At the same time, more contemporary discourse on green and open spaces has revolved around the privatization of such spaces and how that impacts certain aspects of commuity dynamics, like policing and safety. Our goal is to understand how open spaces impact community safety, and to see if our findings point in the direction of green spaces existing as an alternative to policing and/or as a method of promoting community safety.

# Spatial Scope
Spatial scope: The City of San Francisco
Space is key to our research. The Police Department data provides the locations of reported incidents. The land use data provides locations of open space. We will look at the reported incident’s proximity to open green space locations. 
We will use time to examine if there is a significant variation in crime and green space correlation across years. 
 
# Description of Data Sources
## [*SF Police Department Incident Reports*](https://data.sfgov.org/Public-Safety/Police-Department-Incident-Reports-2018-to-Present/wg3w-h783)
This dataset provides San Francisco Police Department incident reports that have been filed as of January 1, 2018. Included is the date and time the incident occurred as well as incident category, subcategory and description. There are three types of reports:
Initial Reports: the first report filed by officers for an incident
Coplogic Reports: incident reports filed by members of the public using SFPD’s online reporting system
Vehicle Reports: any incident reports related to stolen and/or recovered vehicles
## [*SF Land Use*](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Land-Use/us3s-fp9q)
This dataset provides a land use designation for every parcel in San Francisco. The land use categories are derived from a range of city and commercial databases. The determining factor for a parcel's LANDUSE is if the square footage of any non-residential use is 80% or more of its total uses. Otherwise it becomes MIXED. The dataset is available both as a shapefile and a geojson file. For the purposes of our research, the dataset will be cleaned to only include entries designated as “Openspace.” 
# Scope of Intended Analysis and Resulting Visualizations
The data derived from the datasets above will be used to analyze the relationship between open green space and crime rates. The end goal is to create a cartographic visualization that highlights the crime rate (number of reported crimes / total population) by neighborhood and map that against green spaces across the city and investigate any potential overlap. Alternatively, it could be interesting to identify areas with higher rates of felony crimes and those with higher rates of petty crimes and map them against open green spaces to analyze whether there’s any overlap between the degree of crime and green spaces. To achieve this level of analysis would require categorizing crime rates from the data above as either felonies or petty crimes.
# Conclusion
Our research will provide insight into whether open green space in San Francisco increases crime or reduces it. How does it vary by neighborhood? We want to understand how green space influences potential offenders and victims. We can then better understand the spatial distribution of crime and green space in order to recommend crime prevention measures.
